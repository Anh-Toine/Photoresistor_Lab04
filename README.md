# Photoresistor_Lab04
This is my take on a project that I have been assigned to do. It involves taking analog signals as input and doing something with regards to those signals, which, in this case, the intensity of the lighting in my bedroom, and the device taking in analog signals is a photoresistor.
The blue LED lights up whenever the analog signal is above 500, the yellow LED lights up whenever it fluctuates between 100 and 500, and finally, the red LED lights up whenver it falls below 100.
The value of the signal is displayed on the 16x2 LCD.

## Parts used
- 3 LEDS(Blue,Yellow,Red)
- 1 Photoresistor
- 4 220Î© resistors
- 1 Potentiometer
- 1 16x2 LCD
- 1 Arduino board(UNO)
- 3 Jumper wires(Male to Female)
- 18 Wires
